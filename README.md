# Coronary-Arteries-Segmentation-with-BasicUNet
This repository contains the code developed for my thesis, which focuses on the segmentation of coronary arteries using the ImageCAS medical imaging dataset. The overall implementation—particularly the training and validation procedures—was inspired by MONAI’s official tutorials available on GitHub. The final codebase integrates elements from two key examples: "3D Brain Tumor Segmentation with Swin UNETR (BraTS 21 Challenge)" and "3D Multi-organ Segmentation with UNETR (BTCV Challenge)". This project leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques and MONAI’s powerful toolset to adapt and optimize a segmentation pipeline specifically for coronary artery data.
